## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application uses a **Static Multi-Page Application (MPA)** architecture with vanilla JavaScript modules:
- **Technology Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **UI Framework**: Custom CSS with utility classes and component-based styling
- **Module System**: ES6 modules with class-based architecture
- **State Management**: Client-side JavaScript classes managing local state
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming

### Backend Architecture
The system integrates with **Firebase** as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL document database)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for document/image uploads
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore real-time listeners for live data synchronization

### Authentication Strategy
- **Firebase Authentication** with multiple sign-in methods
- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- Session management with automatic redirects
- Protected routes with auth state checking

## Key Components

### 1. Core Management Modules
- **StudentManager**: Handles student registration, profile management, and room assignments
- **RoomManager**: Manages room inventory, capacity, and availability
- **FeeManager**: Tracks fee payments, generates dues reports, and manages financial records
- **ReportManager**: Generates comprehensive PDF reports for students and fees with advanced filtering
- **NoticeManager**: Creates and broadcasts announcements and notifications
- **ComplaintManager**: Handles student complaints and resolution tracking
- **Dashboard**: Provides overview statistics and system health metrics

### 2. Authentication & Security
- **AuthManager**: Centralized authentication handling
- Protected page access with redirect logic
- User session management
- Role-based access control (admin-focused)

### 3. Utility Systems
- **Utils**: Common formatting, validation, and UI helper functions
- **FirebaseConfig**: Centralized Firebase service initialization
- Real-time data synchronization across all modules

## Data Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow
```
Login Page → Firebase Auth → Session Check → Dashboard Redirect
```

### 2. Data Management Flow
```
User Action → Module Class → Firebase API → Firestore → Real-time Listener → UI Update
```

### 3. File Upload Flow
```
Form Upload → Firebase Storage → URL Generation → Firestore Document Update
```

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Firebase SDK v10.7.1**: Backend services (auth, firestore, storage)
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library
- **Google Fonts (Inter)**: Typography
- **Chart.js**: Dashboard analytics and visualizations

### Firebase Services Used
- **Authentication**: User management and session handling
- **Firestore**: Primary database for all application data
- **Storage**: File and image storage

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static Site Hosting**: Designed for Firebase Hosting or similar static hosts
- **Client-Side Routing**: Multi-page application with individual HTML files
- **Asset Organization**: Structured CSS and JS folders for maintainability

### Recommended Deployment
1. **Firebase Hosting** for seamless integration with backend services
2. **CDN Distribution** for global performance
3. **HTTPS Enforcement** for security compliance
4. **Environment Configuration** for different stages (dev/staging/prod)

### Key Considerations
- All JavaScript modules use ES6 imports with CDN-based Firebase SDK
- No build process required - direct static file serving
- Real-time features require persistent WebSocket connections
- Authentication state persists across browser sessions
- Mobile-responsive design for cross-device compatibility

### Database Collections Structure
```
- students: Student profiles and room assignments
- rooms: Room inventory and capacity management
- fees: Payment records and dues tracking
- notices: Announcements and notifications
- complaints: Issue tracking and resolution
```

The system is designed for easy maintenance and scalability, with modular JavaScript architecture and Firebase's managed backend services handling infrastructure concerns.
